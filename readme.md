# HTML Chunk Loader

## Node SSR/SSG Configurable Template Engine

### Installation

Create a directory called views/ and inside it create pages/ and partials/ insert your chunks into these folders. Check the views directory in the github repository for an example setup.

This is a work in progress, so don't expect much yet in it's current state beyond proof of concept.
